<h2 class="about-title">MapReduce</h2>

<p class="about">
    MapReduce is a programming model and an associated implementation for processing and generating large data sets
    with a parallel, distributed algorithm on a cluster. Conceptually similar approaches have been very well known
    since 1995 with the Message Passing Interface standard having reduce and scatter operations.
</p>

<p class="about">
    A MapReduce program is composed of a Map() procedure (method) that performs filtering and sorting (such as sorting
    students by first name into queues, one queue for each name) and a Reduce() method that performs a summary
    operation (such as counting the number of students in each queue, yielding name frequencies). The "MapReduce
    System" (also called "infrastructure" or "framework") orchestrates the processing by marshalling the distributed
    servers, running the various tasks in parallel, managing all communications and data transfers between the various
    parts of the system, and providing for redundancy and fault tolerance.
</p>

<p class="about">
    The model is inspired by the map and reduce functions commonly used in functional programming, although their
    purpose in the MapReduce framework is not the same as in their original forms. The key contributions of the
    MapReduce framework are not the actual map and reduce functions, but the scalability and fault-tolerance achieved
    for a variety of applications by optimizing the execution engine once. As such, a single-threaded implementation of
    MapReduce will usually not be faster than a traditional (non-MapReduce) implementation; any gains are usually only
    seen with multi-threaded implementations. The use of this model is beneficial only when the optimized distributed
    shuffle operation (which reduces network communication cost) and fault tolerance features of the MapReduce
    framework come into play. Optimizing the communication cost is essential to a good MapReduce algorithm.
</p>

<p class="about">
    MapReduce libraries have been written in many programming languages, with different levels of optimization.
    A popular open-source implementation that has support for distributed shuffles is part of Apache Hadoop. The name
    MapReduce originally referred to the proprietary Google technology, but has since been genericized. By 2014,
    Google was no longer using MapReduce as their primary Big Data processing model, and development on Apache Mahout
    had moved on to more capable and less disk-oriented mechanisms that incorporated full map and reduce capabilities.
